# Description Lionh34rt#4305
Keybased lab scripts based on the original qb-moneywash and qb-methlab.
After updating my keylabs scripts I decided to upload my outdated scripts
Uses the bob74_ipl interiors (I don't know what happened to the methlab interior while making the preview, that was a first one)
Timers and ingredients needed are customizable. Obviously for the preview I made everything very short.
-> Feel free to change as much as you want to these scripts and some credits are appreciated =)

I don't plan to maintain this repository

# Installation
Create the necessary items (weed brick, coke brick, meth package, meth, and all the keys, ...) in your shared.lua
Add the resources to your FiveM server and start them.

# Shared.lua labkeys
```
--LabKeys
["methkey"] 				= {["name"] = "methkey", 					["label"] = "methkey", 					["weight"] = 0, 		["type"] = "item", 		["image"] = "methkey.png", 				["unique"] = true, 		["useable"] = true, 	["shouldClose"] = false,	   	["combinable"] = nil,   ["description"] = "Meth Lab Access key!"},
